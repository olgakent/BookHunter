<h1>What is BookHunter?</h1>

BookHunter is a platform exclusive to Hunter College students that allows the for listing and exchanging of textbooks relating to your course work. BookHunter was created to alleviate stress associated with getting ready for a new semester.

1. List textbooks they no longer want.

2. Request new textbooks through their wishlist.

3. Message others users to perform an exchange.
